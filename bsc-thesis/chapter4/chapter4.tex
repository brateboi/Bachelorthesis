\chapter{Discretized connection evaluation}
% \paragraph{Rotation coefficient calculation}
% Open Question from me: In the paper, they say that in general $R_{\ell}$ cannot be simplified
% to $\exp (-\int_{\ell}\omega)$, because of the noncommutativity of rotations in 3D.
% I say we can, because of the closedness of our one-form, therefore the
% integral is path-independent.
